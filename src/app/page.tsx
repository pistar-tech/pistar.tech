                      In today&apos;s sedentary lifestyle, a person spends a
                      substantial amount of time in a sitting position. Having a
                      poor sitting posture can put more stress on specific
                      muscles and joints, forcing them to be overworked and
                      causing them to fatigue which results in back pains. This
                      is already leading to widespread chronic back pain and
                      other related health issues, particularly in young adults.
                      <br /> <br />
                      According to the estimates, 60% of the Indian population
                      experiences back pain at some time in their lives. It is
                      the third most common reason for a doctor&apos;s visit,
                      and as we all know that “Prevention is better than cure”,
                      We present to you, a patented smart seating solution
                      called- smart chair which is the best preventive measure
                      for all types of pains that may occur to incorrect seating

                      Incorrect posture puts pressure on muscles, joints, and
                      ligaments leading to many health problems like back, neck,
                      and shoulder aches. “Health is Wealth” and when we are
                      talking about a healthy body, posture is as important as
                      eating in the right way and regular exercising. Correct
                      posture means the bones are properly aligned, and the
                      weight of the body is well distributed so that the muscles
                      and joints can work in a more efficient, energetic, and
                      less stressful way. Hence, it is very important for us to
                      sit in a correct posture.
                      <br /> <br />
                      To solve the above-mentioned problem, we present a
                      flexible pressure-sensor-array-based smart chair that
                      analyses sitting posture in real-time using artificial
                      intelligence algorithms. The proposed smart chair will
                      monitor the sitting posture of the user and suggest
                      corrective action. It will identify the posture of the
                      person and tell us if the user is sitting in the right way
                      or not, by mapping the body pressure at the seat and at
                      the backrest. This will be done by training an artificial
                      intelligence-based software to detect the baseline
                      pressure distribution for an individual and then determine
                      the variations.

                      At PiStarTech, we are committed to enhancing healthcare
                      with innovative solutions that bridge the gap between
                      technology and medical practice. Our flagship product, the
                      <b> Diabetic PodiaScan Mat (Podiascanner Mat)</b>, is an
                      advanced, research-backed foot pressure analysis system
                      designed to support medical professionals in diagnosing
                      and treating foot-related ailments, particularly for
                      diabetic patients.
                      <br />
                      The Podiascanner Mat is a portable and flexible
                      pressure-sensing mat that provides both static and dynamic
                      podiatric pressure patterns (SPPP and DPPP). These
                      insights help doctors detect normal and abnormal foot
                      posture, track patient recovery post-injury or surgery,
                      and authenticate clinical findings with accurate,
                      quantifiable data. With just a 5-second scan, healthcare
                      professionals can prescribe customized treatments,
                      recommend proper footwear, and monitor progress over time.
                      <br />
                      Our mission is to make affordable, precise, and
                      evidence-based foot scanning technology accessible to a
                      wider range of medical professionals, empowering them to
                      provide better care. Whether you&#39;re looking to improve
                      diagnosis accuracy, enhance patient trust through
                      cutting-edge technology, or monitor patient progress
